# Custom Development

Digital Trails is currently in limited release within the University of Virginia.

If you're a UVA researcher requiring new Digital Trails functionality, you have two options:
  
  1. Partner with us and purchase our developer's time to create the functionality. [Contact us](/about#Contact) for more information.
  2. Implement the functionality on your own and make a pull request at [github.com/digital-trails/digital-trails](http://github.com/digital-trails/digital-trails)
